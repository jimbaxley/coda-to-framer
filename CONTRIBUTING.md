# Contributing to Framer API Sync Pack

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Framer API Sync Pack! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **TypeScript** knowledge (basic)
- **Git**

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # On GitHub, click "Fork" on the repository page
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/coda-to-framer.git
   cd coda-to-framer
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/jimbaxley/coda-to-framer.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles TypeScript code in `src/` to JavaScript in `build/`.

### Validating

Before attempting to upload, validate your pack:

```bash
npm run validate
```

This checks for syntax errors and compatibility issues.

### Testing Locally

To test in Coda:

1. **Build the pack**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload to Coda**
   ```bash
   npm run upload
   ```

3. **Test in your Coda document** - Use the formula directly in a doc

## Making Changes

### What to Modify

- **Pack logic**: [`src/pack.ts`](src/pack.ts)
- **Configuration**: [`package.json`](package.json), [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json)
- **Documentation**: [`README.md`](README.md), [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### What NOT to Modify

- `build/` - Generated files
- `.gitignore` - Unless you have a specific reason
- `manifest.json` - Auto-generated by Coda CLI

### Code Style

- Use **TypeScript** for all source code
- Follow **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **descriptive names** for clarity
- Add **comments** for complex logic
- Format code with consistent indentation (2 spaces)

### Package.json Changes

If you add new dependencies:

```bash
npm install your-new-package
git add package.json package-lock.json
```

Avoid adding unnecessary packages.

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your branch** with latest changes
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Build and validate**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run validate
   ```

3. **Test thoroughly** - Use the formula in Coda to verify behavior

4. **Update documentation** - If you changed functionality, update the README

### Submitting Your PR

1. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request on GitHub**
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues: `Fixes #123`
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include any testing details

3. **Wait for review** - A maintainer will review your changes

### PR Guidelines

✅ **Do**:
- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Write clear commit messages
- Update README if behavior changes
- Test in an actual Coda document
- Reference issues when applicable

❌ **Don't**:
- Make multiple unrelated changes in one PR
- Commit build artifacts or dependencies
- Include console logs in production code
- Make style-only changes without functionality updates

## Issue Guidelines

### Reporting Bugs

**Title**: Concise description of the bug

**Description**:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Coda document setup (table structure, column types)
- Worker endpoint being used

**Example**:
```
Title: Sync fails with special characters in collection name

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a table with a row
2. Use SyncTableToFramer with collection name "My & Special Collection"
3. Click execute

Expected: Collection is created/updated
Actual: Error 400 - Invalid collection name

Environment:
- Worker: coda-to-framer-node.vercel.app
- Table: 5 rows, 3 columns
```

### Suggesting Features

**Title**: Brief feature description

**Description**:
- Why this feature would be useful
- How users would use it
- Any relevant examples or use cases

**Example**:
```
Title: Support batch syncing multiple tables

Currently users must run SyncTableToFramer for each table. Would be great to support:
- Syncing multiple tables in one action
- A queue/batch option that processes them sequentially

Use case: Content site with many tables (blog posts, products, etc.) that need to stay in sync
```
